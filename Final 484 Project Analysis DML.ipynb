{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**A few notes before you run the code:**\n","\n","This code should run completely through as long as you change the filepaths. The only caveat is that the numbers you see here might not match what's in the MSE and train and test score accuracy table. That's because when we created the table, we had set a random state for some but not all of the various checks we did. Basically, whenever we change the random state for the draws of the train and test set, we sometimes get drastically different results of the training scores: either the models completely overfit or the training scores are much lower. We attribute this to the overwhelming noise that's in our dataset which tells us that there's really not a good way to predict casualties using our feature matrix. We can submit screenshots of all of the various training and test set scores we've gotten over the last three days when we didn't set the random state as evidence of this if needed. They vary but all consistently get a negative test set score, regardless of the training set score which tells us the same story about the noise."],"metadata":{"id":"C8EYIjx7yZDx"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nQXhSZSOQyTJ","outputId":"a4c1cd3f-ae7c-4b23-8900-9e5c92627467","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681957639808,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":1526,"user":{"displayName":"Hannah
